Good Morning im trying to make Linkedlist extra credit
 ``insertAt(value, index)``
  when I 
  ``insertAt('E', 2)`` 
  if i have allready linkedlist with 4 nodes, 
  ``(A) - > (B) - > (C) -> (D) - > null`` 
  this new Node (E) will be put after (C) node so it will be 
  ``(A) - > (B) - > (C) - > (E) -> (D) - > null``
  My question should it act like array, if index is 2, it should be inserted after Node (B), coz Node (B) is at index [1]?
